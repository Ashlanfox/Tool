1. System Requirements
----------------------

  Hardware:
    • 1 GHz or greater CPU
    • 1 GB or greater memory 
    • 25 MB free hard disk space plus extra room for capture files 

  Operating System (X86, AMD64):
    • Windows XP SP3
    • Windows Vista SP1
    • Windows Server 2003 SP2
    • Windows Server 2008 SP1 (+ IA64 builds)
    • Windows Server 2008 R2
    • Windows 7 RTM
    


-----------------------------------------
2. What's New in Network Monitor 3.4
-----------------------------------------

• User Interface Refresh: The Network Monitor UI has evolved. New features
  have been added and previously hard-to-find features have been made more 
  readily available:
  
  • Parser Configuration Management: Parsers are now installed with profiles 
    that allow you to easily switch between parser configurations with the 
    Parser Profiles toolbar button.  These configurations are also cached, 
    removing the need to recompile when you switch between them.
    
  • Column Management: Network Monitor will automatically choose a column layout 
    based on the type of file being opened. This column layout is applied to the 
    Frame Summary Window. This layout can be modified and saved for future use. 
    In addition, two extra layouts for HTTP and TCP diagnostics are included.

  • Color Rules: Network Monitor can now save sets of Color Rules to files for 
    easy sharing. You can also right-click in the Frame Summary and Frame Details 
    windows to add a new Color Rule. 

  • Window Layout Dropdown: The new window layout dropdown provides multiple 
    configurations for window arrangement. You can move windows by holding down 
    the Shift key while clicking on their title bars. Arrangements are saved 
    for each of the three layout options. The Restore Default Layout option 
    will reset the currently selected layout back to the default.
    
  • "Live" Experts: Experts can now be run during a live capture session. Also, 
    experts that have been recently installed now appear automatically in the 
    Experts menu, without requiring you to open another tab.
    
  • Fixed-Width Font: You can now use a fixed-width font in the Frame Summary window.
  
  • Auto-Apply Aliases: Aliases are now automatically applied and re-applied 
    when created using the right-click add-to-alias feature.
  
• High Performance Filtering: Network Monitor will now enter a high-performance 
  capturing mode when you specify fully qualified capture filters with certain 
  fields in the UI or nmcap (e.g. Frame.Ethernet.IPv4.TCP.Port == 8080).
  
• UTC Timestamps: Network Monitor will now capture and save Time Zone related 
  information in a trace. By default, traces opened with Time Zone information 
  will automatically have times adjusted to your local Time Zone. The original 
  time or Time Zone can be viewed by adding the "Time and Date" column or viewing 
  the Properties under the File menu.
  
• 802.11n & Raw IP Frame Support - Network Monitor now supports monitor mode on 
  802.11n network on Microsoft Windows Vista SP1 and later operating systems as 
  well as Raw IP Frames on Microsoft Windows 7.

• Process Tracking in NMCap: It is now possible to capture process tracking 
  information in the NMCap command-line tool. It will automatically be enabled 
  when using a filter, or can be manually enabled using the "/CaptureProcesses" flag.

-----------------------------------------------
3. Installation Change from Network Monitor 3.2
-----------------------------------------------

The Network Monitor core engine has been decoupled from the parser set. 

To install the full Network Monitor 3.4 product:
• Run Netmonsetup.exe

To uninstall the full Network Monitor 3.4 product:
  1. Go to Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel
  2. Uninstall both Microsoft Network Monitor 3.4 and Microsoft Network 
  Monitor: Microsoft Parsers 3.4.


-----------------------------------------
4. Breaking Changes from Previous Versions
------------------------------------------

The following changes have been made in the Network Monitor API since version 3.3 RTW.
You do NOT need to recompile your API applications if they were compiled with 3.3 RTW.

• None.


Breaking changes before 3.3 RTW


The following changes apply only to C#. These changes were made between version 3.3 Beta and 3.3 RTW. You must recompile your C# API applications if they were compiled with 3.3 Beta or earlier.

• The NmFrameParseOptions enumeration has been renamed to NmFrameParsingOption.

• The data type of the Options parameter of the NmParseFrame function has been changed from
  UInt32 to NmFrameParsingOption.

• The data type of the Options parameter of the NmParseBuffer function has been changed
  from UInt32 to NmFrameParsingOption.:


The following changes were made in the Network Monitor API between version 3.2 RTW and 3.3 RTW. These
changes apply to all languages. You must recompile your API applications if they were compiled with 3.2 RTW or 
earlier.

• The elements of the NmFrameParserOptimizeOption enumeration have been renamed as
  follows:

    a) NmPaserOptimizeNone to NmParserOptimizeNone

    b) NmPaserOptimizeFull to NmParserOptimizeFull

    c) NmPaserOptimizeLast to NmParserOptimizeLast

• The FrameParsingOption member of the NM_API_CONFIGURATION structure has been
  removed.

The following changes apply only to C# between version 3.2 RTW and 3.3 RTW.
You must recompile your C# API applications if they were compiled with 3.2 RTW or earlier.

• The namespace was changed from Microsoft.Protocols.TestTools.Netmon.API to
  Microsoft.NetworkMonitor.

• A parameter has been added to the NmCreateFrameParser function: OptimizeOption.
  Possible values are elements of the NmFrameParserOptimizeOption enumeration.


-----------------------------------------------------
5.  Capture Driver Requires Administrative Privileges
-----------------------------------------------------

  The Network Monitor 3.4 driver captures network traffic only if it is 
  run with administrator privileges. For Windows XP and Windows Server 
  2003, this requires that the user be logged on as an administrator on the computer 
  (local or domain account.)

  For Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and Windows 7, the Network Monitor 3.4 driver can 
  gain administrative privileges in two ways:

   a)  (Recommended) Place your user account in the Netmon Users group.  
       (This group is created during installation, and the current user is 
       added to the group; adding users to the group requires administrator 
       privileges.) Once added, the user must log off and log back on for the 
       change to take effect. 

	 If you are installing Network Monitor 3.x for the first time, log off 
	 and log back on after installation to enable capturing.

    b)  Run Netmon.exe as an administrator (from an elevated command
        window, or right-click on Run as administrator.)



------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Operating on Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and Windows 7
------------------------------------------------------------------

  To capture traffic on Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008
  you must add your user account to the Netmon Users Group. This
  is usually done during installation for the user installing Network Monitor 3.4.

  NOTE:  After adding your user account, you must log off and log back on for the
         changes to take effect.

  If your account is not in the Netmon Users group, you cannot 
  start a new capture, and this is visible in several
  ways:

   • When you try to start a capture, you will see the error:
     "None of the network adapters are bound to the netmon driver."

   • All adapters in the Select Networks window will show the message:
     "This network adapter is not configured to capture."

  Alternatively, if you are an administrator on the computer, you can run
  Netmon.exe as an administrator (from an elevated command window, or right-click on 
  Run as administrator.)


----------------------------------------------------------------
7. Operating on a Windows Server 2008 Read-only Domain Controller (RODC)
----------------------------------------------------------------

  Normally, when you install Network Monitor, the setup 
  creates a local security group called Netmon Users and adds the 
  installing user to that group. Local groups cannot be created on an 
  Windows Server 2008 RODC, because of its read-only nature. Setup 
  continues, but Network Monitor 3.4 can capture traffic only 
  if it is run with administrative privileges.

  There are three possible workarounds:

    a)  Before installing Network Monitor 3.4 on any DCs in the domain, 
	create a domain-wide group called Netmon Users. This group 
	will be available on RODCs. A subsequent installation of Network 
	Monitor 3.4 on an RODC then behaves normally.

    b)  If Network Monitor 3.4 has already been installed on an RODC, 
	create the domain-wide group Netmon Users on the 
	non-read-only Domain Controller. The group is then replicated 
	to the RODC:
	• Manually add the user, using Active Directory Users and Computers 
          (DSA.MSC).
	• Run “nmconfig /permissions” from an elevated command prompt 
	  on the RODC.

    c)  If Network Monitor 3.4 has already been installed, run Netmon.exe
	as an administrator (from an elevated command window, or right-click 
        on Run as administrator.)


----------------------------------------------------------
8.  Co-existence with Previous Versions of Network Monitor
----------------------------------------------------------

  Network Monitor 3.4 can co-exist with Network Monitor 2.1 on Windows 
  XP (or on Windows Server 2003) as long as the applications are installed in
  separate directories. The default installation directories are:
    • Network Monitor 2.1:  \program files\Microsoft Network Monitor
    • Network Monitor 3.4:  \program files\Microsoft Network Monitor 3

  Because Network Monitor 3 is a complete re-write of the capture engine, 
  the parser engine, and user interface, it is not compatible with parsers 
  or Experts (plug-ins) that were designed for any version of
  Network Monitor 2.

  When you install Network Monitor 3.4, any previous version of Network 
  Monitor 3.x is automatically uninstalled first. Close any 
  Network Monitor executables before installation. 

-----------------------
9.  Providing Feedback
-----------------------
Feedback is provided through connect.microsoft.com. If you are not already
participating in the Network Monitor 3 program, follow these steps to participate:

1. Go to http://connect.microsoft.com, and sign in using your Windows Live ID. 
2. Once you have logged on, click Connection Directory at the 
   top of the page.
3. Apply to participate in the Network Monitor 3 program.

Once you are member of the program you can: 
• File bugs: Go to the Network Monitor 3 Connect page, and click 
  Feedback, and then Submit Feedback. Include as much information in your 
  bug description as possible so that the Network Monitor
  team can reproduce and address the issue.

• Ask questions: Go to the Network Monitor 3 Connect page, and click 
  Newsgroups. Select a category in the left pane. You can 
  read existing threads, reply to threads, or create a new thread.


----------------------------
10.  Default Directory Names
----------------------------

• The default directory for Network Monitor 3.x installation is:
    • \program files\Microsoft Network Monitor 3

• Network Monitor 3.0 was installed in directory 
  "\program files\Microsoft Network Monitor 3.0". If you already have the 
  older version installed, the new installation deletes the 
  \program files\Microsoft Network Monitor 3.0" directory (if no files
  in the directory were modified) and installs in the new directory.

• The default directory for user-generated capture files, parsers, filters 
  and aliases is:
    • \Documents\Network Monitor 3\

  Network Monitor 3.0 stored capture files, parsers, filters and aliases 
  in \Documents\My Network Monitor\
 
• The default directory for NPL files is 
  C:\ProgramData\Microsoft Network Monitor 3\NPL on Windows Vista and Windows 
  Server 2008. On Windows XP and Server 2003, the NPL files are in 
  C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Microsoft Network Monitor 3\NPL
  In Network Monitor 3.1, the NPL files were stored under 
  \program files\Microsoft Network Monitor\NPL. This directory is removed
  (if no files were modified) during the installation of Network Monitor 3.4.


----------------------------------
11. Known Issues for All Platforms
----------------------------------

• Network Monitor 3.4 is currently not recommended for use on production 
  systems. 

  Network Monitor 3.4 may use significant system resources:

  1.  Disk space: When capturing, Network Monitor 3.4 currently stores 
      frames in a sequence of capture files named cap*.tmp in your Temp 
      directory. 
      If Network Monitor 3.4 is left capturing, by default it continues 
      to store a series of these files until your disc is within 2 percent of being 
      full. Then, it stops capturing. You can configure the temporary file
      size, the disk space limit, and the location of the files (for the UI)
      from Tools\Options\Capture. The location of these temporary capture files
      is not configurable for NMCap and the Network Monitor API. For NMCap and NMAPI, 
      the location is set by the system Temp path. According to MSDN, the Temp path 
      corresponds to one of the following environment variables (the first one 
      in the list that exists): 
        %TMP%
        %TEMP%
        %USERPROFILE%
        Windows Directory
 	
      To change the location of the temporary capture files for NMCap or 
      NMAPI, change the value of the system Temp path.

      You can also limit the total disk space used to buffer captured frames
      by modifying the value of the following registry key: 
      HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Netmon3\Settings\Capture\RootChainCaptureSizeLimit
      The DWORD value of the key is the maximum size of the capture buffer, 
      in MB. When the limit is reached, Network Monitor 3.4 stops capturing

  2.  Memory utilization: In addition to capturing, Network Monitor 3.4 
      assigns properties to frames and groups them into conversations, 
      using these properties. It then displays these conversations and their
      related frames in a tree. By default, conversations
      are enabled. If you notice significant memory consumption 
      while using Network Monitor 3.4, disable conversations by going to 
      Tools\Options\Capture.

  3.  Processor utilization: As described in the preceding paragraph,
      if conversation support is enabled, processor utilization may be
      significant when processing large numbers of frames.  Disable 
      conversations if you are concerned with processor utilization.

• If any Network Monitor instances are running during network adapter disable or removal,
  you will need to close all open instances before you start a new instance of Network
  Monitor if you wish to get the correct state of enabled network adapters in the new
  instance. If you start a new instance of Network Monitor with the old instances
  still running, the new instance of Network Monitor will have all network interfaces
  displayed with IP address value "None", and all of the network interfaces will be
  unchecked by default. You will still be able to capture on a specific network 
  interface in the new instance; however you will need to manually check the interface
  you would like to capture in the "Select Network" window.

• When installing, uninstalling, or upgrading Network Monitor with a wireless,
  RAS, or PPPOe connection, the connection may be interrupted or disconnected.
  You may need to manually reset the connection.  

• If the operating system on which Network Monitor is installed is upgraded to Windows 7, 
  the Network Monitor driver is no longer bound to the operating system driver. For more 
  information, see the Knowledge Base article here: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/968216. 
  To rebind the Network Monitor driver, enter the following in an elevated command window: 
    nmconfig.exe /install. 

• If you have installed Network Monitor 3.4 and you want to use the older 
  Network Monitor 3.0, manually uninstall version 3.4 first, before 
  installing 3.0. Do not install version 3.0 over 3.4.

• If you installed a previous installation of Network Monitor to a non-standard
  location, Network Monitor 3.4 does not remove it.  Please remove the previous
  version of Network Monitor before installing 3.4.

• If you uninstall the Microsoft Network Monitor 3.4 program, and then try to run
  the Microsoft_Parsers.msi, the MSI fails to run. You must 
  reinstall Microsoft Network Monitor 3.4 to run the Microsoft_Parsers.msi.

• You can configure the disk limit in Network Monitor from Tools\Options\Capture.  
  When your total disk usage reaches this limit, Network Monitor stops capturing
  traffic. 

• You can configure the total disk space available to Network Monitor to buffer captured
  frames using the registry key:
  HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Netmon3\Settings\Capture\RootChainCaptureSizeLimit
  
  The default value is 20 GB. When this limit is reached, Network Monitor stops capturing
  traffic and the dropped frame number increases. You are not informed 
  that the limit has been reached.

• The minimum size of a truncated frame is fixed at 14 bytes.

• Network Monitor 3.4 defaults to capturing local traffic only.  
  Capturing all traffic can be enabled (promiscuous mode) by selecting
  a Network adapter in the Select Networks window and clicking the 
  P-mode button. This setting is not persistent across sessions. 
  Once you exit Network Monitor 3.4 and restart the application, capturing
  goes back to local only.

• Enabling or disabling conversation options (from Tools\Options\Capture),
  does not change the options for NMCap. 
  For NMCap, conversations are always enabled, and you must disable them 
  using the DisableConversations flag.

• You cannot filter on a conversation property with NMCap.

• While capturing live data, Network Monitor may not be able to associate each frame to 
  the sending process because the association is attempted when the frame arrives. 
  If the process has disappeared, the frame is assigned to the unknown process. This 
  causes the following issues:
	1. Right-clicking to find a conversation may not work.
	2. Conversations can occur under both a known process and the unknown process
		nodes in the tree.
  You can correct this issue by saving the trace and reopening it.

• When using NMCap, you must specify UDP in your filter in order to capture UDP processes.
  For example, to capture all processes, including TCP and UDP, you would use the following
  command: nmcap /network * /capture UDP or !UDP /file foo.cap /captureprocesses

• On Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008, you can set scanning options for a 
  native WiFi driver in monitor mode by double-clicking on the wireless 
  adapter in the Select Networks window, and then clicking on 
  Scanning Options.

  Older a/b/g or Current 802.11n WiFi drivers may not support monitor mode 
  correctly. Some drivers cause system hangs or crashes when placed in monitor 
  mode. Please ensure you have an up-to-date driver. More information will be 
  posted here when available: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=88370.

• Placing a wireless adapter in monitor mode breaks that 
  adapter's wireless data connection. To restore connectivity, place 
  the wireless adapter in local mode. This is done automatically when 
  you close the WiFi Scanning Options tool. 

• If you save a capture on a Windows Vista virtual machine to a network drive 
  that is mapped to the host machine, the file is corrupted. The 
  work-around is to create a network share on the host computer and save 
  the file directly to the network share. 

• When changing a parser configurations, a slight delay is possible while the engine is 
  cleared and reloaded.

• While capturing live traffic and pending frames remain, it is not possible to change 
  parser profiles.  It is still recommended that you save your current capture to a new file 
  before reloading parsers

• Default is no longer recognized as a valid parameter for the NPL 
  RegisterBefore plug-in

• The filters on the following fields have been found to not work consistently
  between the Network Monitor UI and the command-line version:
    rpchttp.RTSPacket.Flags.RTS_FLAG_ECHO
    RAPRBIN.IRASrv.RAPIRASrv_GetNoviceUserInfo.Request.Pointer.ReferentID
    soh.Microsoft.SSoH.SystemHealthEntityId.SystemHealthId.VendorCode

• Using a filter on an NPL pair (for example, IPv4.Address) in conjunction with a
  filter on a constituent of the pair (for example, IPv4.SourceAddress) causes
  incorrect filtering.

• Using ipv4.Address does not return all frames going to and from a given address.
  To return all frames, combine ipv4.SourceAddress with ipv4.DestinationAddress using
  an OR operation. For example, ipv4.SourceAddress == 192.168.81.41 OR 
  ipv4.DestinationAddress == 192.168.81.41

• The filter FrameVariable.TimeDelta does not work as expected for comparison 
  operations.

• If you include the same file twice in Sparser.npl, this causes a compilation
  error.

• Protocols that embed others may displace the original property values used to 
  display the source and destination addresses, as well as other properties. This occurs 
  because the last protocol that writes a property is the one that is 
  displayed.

• Modifying a frame in the Hex Details window changes the time offset of the frame
  that you edit.

• The Network Monitor API does not save information about processes to the 
  capture file. Process tracking is only available from the Network Monitor UI 
  and NMCap. 

• The API function NmCreateCapture does not fail if you pass it an invalid path.
  It returns success and the handle is valid. But once you call NmAddFrame, it
  returns ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND.

• Some API functions may return ERROR_NO_MATCH (1169), for example,
  NmGetPropertyValueById. This should be interpreted as ERROR_NOT_FOUND (1168).

• Be aware that the NmApiClose call returns immediately while NMAPI is still cleaning up. 
  If the NmCaptureCallbackExitMode.NmReturnRemainFrames is used, callbacks may continue 
  to be received after NmApiClose was called. In a scenario when NMAPI is 
  loaded dynamically (e.g. using the LoadLibrary Win32 API call) the fact that NmApiClose 
  executes asynchronously can lead to an access violation and application crash if NMAPI 
  is unloaded before cleaning is finished.
